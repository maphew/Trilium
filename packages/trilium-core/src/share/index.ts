/**
 * The share subsystem: the read-only cache of the `_share` subtree (shaca), the renderer that turns
 * one of its notes into a page, and the transport-neutral route handlers over both.
 *
 * Deliberately kept out of the `@triliumnext/core` barrel: the browser build reaches it through a
 * dynamic import, which only defers its cost — EJS, the share theme and the syntax highlighter —
 * while nothing in the eager graph imports it.
