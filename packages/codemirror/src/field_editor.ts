 * line and keeps its indentation, for a value the user lays out over several of them; `singleLine`
 * holds the value to one line instead.
 *
 * `onArrowDown` and `onEscape` run only while no completion is open or pending, so a key the popup
 * drops does not move focus out of the editor instead. An IME keeps Enter for as long as it is
 * composing.
 *
 * It sits apart from the editor in `index.ts` so a consumer that wants a plain input does not
 * load the language, theme and completion machinery a code note needs.
