/**
 * A replacement for CKEditor's `MentionUI` that finds the markers typed in the editor and runs the
 * host's list for each: it reports the query, forwards the keys while the list is open and commits
 * what the list picks. What a list shows and how it draws it are the host's (`mention.hostedFeeds`).
 *
 * It also fixes three behaviours of upstream's, which we can neither configure nor subclass around,
 * since every interesting member of `MentionUI` is `private`:
 *
 * 1. **Escape actually dismisses.** Upstream's Escape handler only removes the model marker, but its
 *    `TextWatcher` re-evaluates the text on the very next keystroke, the pattern still matches, and
 *    the list reopens. Trilium worked around that by *inserting a ` ` en-space* into the document
 *    so the (also patched) pattern could no longer match — which corrupts data: the attribute lexer
 *    treats only U+0020 as a separator, so `#foo<en-space> #bar` fails to parse and the attribute
 *    list becomes unsaveable. Here dismissal is state ({@link #_dismissedAt}), not a document edit.
 * 2. **The list opens on typing only.** `TextWatcher` fires `matched:selection` on any direct caret
 *    move, and upstream listens to plain `matched`, so merely *clicking* into an existing `#myLabel`
 *    reopens the list — and since it also pre-selects the first item, the Enter meant to save the
 *    attributes commits a suggestion instead.
 * 3. **A stale query closes the list.** See {@link createMarkerPattern}.
 *
 * The `mention` model attribute, its post-fixers and the `mention` command are reused from upstream
 * unchanged. Pair this plugin with `MentionEditing` rather than the `Mention` façade, which pulls in
 * `MentionUI` too.
