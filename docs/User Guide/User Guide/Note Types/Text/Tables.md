# Tables
Tables are a powerful feature for <a class="reference-link" href="../Text.md">Text</a> notes, since editing them is generally easy.

<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img style="aspect-ratio:176/204;" src="2_Tables_image.png" width="176" height="204"></figure>

To create a table, simply press the table button and select with the mouse the desired amount of columns and rows, as indicated in the adjacent figure.

## Formatting toolbar

When a table is selected, a special formatting toolbar will appear:

<img src="3_Tables_image.png" width="384" height="100">

## Context menu

Since v0.106.0, right-clicking anywhere inside a table opens a context menu with the most common table operations:

*   _Insert row above_ and _Insert row below_ insert a blank row next to the row of the current cell. When the selection spans multiple rows, the same number of rows is inserted.
*   _Insert column to the left_ and _Insert column to the right_ work the same way for columns.
*   _Delete rows_ and _Delete columns_ remove every row or column the selection touches, even when only some of their cells are selected.
*   _Merge cells_ merges the selected cells into one. The selected cells must form a rectangle.
*   _Split cells_ splits each selected cell in two, either _Vertically_ or _Horizontally_.

Right-clicking a cell that is not part of the current selection moves the cursor there first, so the menu always applies to the cell under the pointer.

> [!NOTE]
> In the browser, Trilium's menu replaces the browser's own context menu inside tables. To reach the browser's menu (for example for its spell checking suggestions), hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> while right-clicking. The desktop application is unaffected, since its menu already includes the spelling suggestions.

## Navigating a table

*   Using the mouse:
    *   Click on a cell to focus it.
    *   Click the <span class="tn-icon cke cke-return-arrow"></span> button at the top or the bottom of a table to insert an empty paragraph near it.
    *   Click the <span style="color:hsl(0,0%,60%);"><span class="tn-icon cke cke-drag-handle"></span></span> button at the top-left of the table to select it entirely (for easy copy-pasting or cutting) or drag and drop it to relocate the table.
*   Using the keyboard:
    *   Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to easily navigate between cells.
    *   It's also possible to use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to go to the next cell and Shift+Tab to go to the previous cell.
    *   Unlike arrow keys, pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> at the end of the table (last row, last column) will create a new row automatically.
    *   To select multiple cells, hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> while using the arrow keys.

## Resizing cells

*   Columns can be resized by hovering the mouse over the border of two adjacent cells and dragging it.
*   By default, the row height is not adjustable using the mouse, but it can be configured from the cell settings (see below).
*   To adjust exactly the width (in pixels or percentages) of a cell, select the <span class="tn-icon cke cke-table-cell-properties"></span> button.

## Inserting new rows and new columns

*   To insert a new column, click on a desired location, then press the <span class="tn-icon cke cke-table-column"></span> button from the formatting toolbar and select _Insert column left or right._
*   To insert a new row, click on a desired location, then press the <span class="tn-icon cke cke-table-row"></span> button and select _Insert row above_ or _below_.
    *   A quicker alternative to creating a new row while at the end of the table is to press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.
*   Both operations are also available in the [context menu](#context-menu), which inserts as many rows or columns as the selection spans.

## Moving rows and columns

Since v0.106.0, rows and columns can be reordered with the keyboard:

*   <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd> move the rows touched by the selection up or down.
*   <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd> move the columns touched by the selection left or right.

Merged cells are never split by a move. The rows or columns held together by a merged cell travel as one block, and moving toward such a block jumps over it entirely.

When the table has a header row, a header row moved below the header area becomes a regular row, and a regular row moved into the header area becomes a header row. Header columns behave the same way.

Outside of tables, <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd> keep navigating the note history, and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd> keep moving the current paragraph.

## Merging cells

To merge two or more cells together, simply select them via drag & drop and press the <span class="tn-icon cke cke-table-merge-cell"></span> button from the formatting toolbar.

More options are available by pressing the arrow next to it:

*   Click on a single cell and select Merge cell up/down/right/left to merge with an adjacent cell.
*   Select _Split cell vertically_ or _horizontally_, to split a cell into multiple cells (can also be used to undo a merge).

Merging and splitting are also available by right-clicking the selected cells, via the [context menu](#context-menu).

## Table properties

<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img style="aspect-ratio:312/311;" src="Tables_image.png" width="312" height="311"></figure>

The table properties can be accessed via the <span class="tn-icon cke cke-table-properties"></span> button and allows for the following adjustments:

*   Border (not the border of the cells, but the outer rim of the table), which includes the style (single, double), color and width.
*   The background color, with none set by default.
*   The width and height of the table in percentage (must end with `%`) or pixels (must end with `px`).
*   The alignment of the table.
    *   Left or right-aligned, case in which the text will flow next to it.
    *   Centered, case in which text will avoid the table, regardless of the table width.

The table will immediately update to reflect the changes, but the _Save_ button must be pressed for the changes to persist.

## Cell properties

<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img style="aspect-ratio:320/386;" src="1_Tables_image.png" width="320" height="386"></figure>

Similarly to table properties, the <span class="tn-icon cke cke-table-cell-properties"></span> button opens a popup which adjusts the styling of one or more cells (based on the user's selection).

The following options can be adjusted:

*   The border style, color and width (same as table properties), but applying to the current cell only.
*   The background color, with none set by default.
*   The width and height of the cell in percentage (must end with `%`) or pixels (must end with `px`).
*   The padding (the distance of the text compared to the cell's borders).
*   The alignment of the text, both horizontally (left, centered, right, justified) and vertically (top, middle or bottom).

The cell will immediately update to reflect the changes, but the _Save_ button must be pressed for the changes to persist.

## Caption

Press the <span class="tn-icon cke cke-caption"></span> button to insert a caption or a text description of the table, which is going to be displayed above the table.

## Table borders

By default, tables will come with a predefined gray border.

To adjust the borders, follow these steps:

1.  Select the table.
2.  In the floating panel, select the _Table properties_ option (<span class="tn-icon cke cke-table-properties"></span>).
    1.  Look for the _Border_ section at the top of the newly opened panel.
    2.  This will control the outer borders of the table.
    3.  Select a style for the border. Generally _Single_ is the desirable option.
    4.  Select a color for the border.
    5.  Select a width for the border, expressed in pixels.
3.  Select all the cells of the table and then press the _Cell properties_ option (<span class="tn-icon cke cke-table-cell-properties"></span>).
    1.  This will control the inner borders of the table, at cell level.
    2.  Note that it's possible to change the borders individually by selecting one or more cells, case in which it will only change the borders that intersect these cells.
    3.  Repeat the same steps as from step (2).

### Tables with invisible borders

Tables can be set to have invisible borders in order to allow for basic layouts (columns, grids) of text or [images](Images.md) without the distraction of their border:

1.  First insert a table with the desired number of columns and rows.
2.  Select the entire table.
3.  In _Table properties_, set:
    1.  _Style_ to _Single_
    2.  _Color_ to `transparent`
    3.  Width to `1px`.
4.  In Cell Properties, set the same as on the previous step.

## Table indentation

Since v0.104.1, tables can be indented as a block (the whole table moves, rather than just the content of a cell).

1.  Click the <span style="color:hsl(0,0%,60%);"><span class="tn-icon cke cke-drag-handle"></span></span> button to select the entire table. Otherwise, the indentation applies only to the current cell's content.
2.  Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to increase the indent, or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to decrease it. Alternatively, use the indentation buttons in the formatting toolbar.

Markdown does not support indented tables, so the indentation is lost when converting to Markdown.

## Markdown import/export

Simple tables are exported in GitHub-flavored Markdown format (e.g. a series of `|` items). If the table is found to be more complex (it contains HTML elements, has custom sizes or images), the table is converted to a HTML one instead.

Generally formatting loss should be minimal when exported to Markdown due to the fallback to HTML formatting.
