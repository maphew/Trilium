/**
 * What stands between a request to enable backend scripting and the file that grants it.
 *
 * The desktop asks the operating system to draw this dialog, because a note script can reach every
 * dialog the application draws for itself. Here the equivalent is `confirm()`: the browser draws
 * it, a page cannot overlay it, click it or read its answer, and script execution stops dead until
 * the user has answered. That makes a script calling {@link StandaloneSecurityApi} no better off
 * than a script clicking the toggle in the settings would be — it summons the real dialog, with
 * the real warning, and gets whatever the user says.
 *
 * Three things beyond the dialog itself, in the order they stop an attempt:
 *
 * - The function `confirm` was at load, captured below. A script that assigns `window.confirm =
 *   () => true` replaces what everything else on the page sees, not what this calls.
 * - Transient user activation, where the browser tracks it. A script on a timer has none, so it
 *   never reaches the dialog at all; the toggle the user just clicked does.
 * - A decline limit, which is the backstop where activation is not tracked (Firefox). A script
 *   that keeps asking gets {@link MAX_DECLINES} dialogs and then silence, so it cannot wear the
 *   user down into clicking OK. One accidental Cancel does not cost the user the toggle, and the
 *   limit covers granting only, so it can never stand between the user and turning a capability
 *   back off.
 *
