 * Zooms the content on a wheel notch, anchored on the pointer, in place of the library's own wheel

 * both the `scale * (k - 1)` a notch in needs and the `scale * (1 - 1 / k)` a notch back needs, so a
 * notch each way lands at `1 - k²` of the starting scale and scrubbing shrinks the view. The library
 * picks its step before it reads the event, so no value of `wheel.step` fixes that; this reads the
 * direction from `deltaY` and computes a target scale instead.
 *
 * `zoomIn`/`zoomOut` take the increment up to that target, so the library still clamps to
 * `minScale`/`maxScale` and recomputes its bounds. It zooms toward the middle of the view, so the
 * `setTransform` that follows re-anchors the content under the pointer.
 *
 * With `isFocusRequired`, the wheel scrolls the page until `element` has focus or is fullscreen.
