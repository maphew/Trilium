 * Takes a note off the map, having asked first, and offers to delete it while it is at it.

 * longer showed and the reader had to go hunting for in the tree — taking a note off the map and
 * getting rid of it are different wishes, and only one of them was granted. What deleting would
 * actually cost is the dialog's to work out and to say (see confirmDeleteNoteBoxWithNote); all this
 * has to know is which branch the map holds the note by.
 *
 * A track is the exception, and is deleted or left alone: its line is drawn from the note's own file
 * rather than from a location written on it, so there is no taking it off the map and keeping it —
 * the note is the track. That is also why it is not offered under the same name (see ContextMenus).

 * The mime is pinned to what the map draws tracks by (see NoteGpxTrackWrapper in index.tsx) rather
