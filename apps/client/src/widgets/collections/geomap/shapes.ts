/**
 * How a drawn shape is written onto its note, and read back off it.
 *
 * A shape lives in a label the way a marker's location does (see `LOCATION_ATTRIBUTE` in Markers):
 * the same `lat,lng` atom, pluralized — a prefix naming what the points make, then the points.
 * `#geoShape=line:48.858093,2.294694 48.860294,2.338629` is the marker format anyone has already
 * read, walked along a path; a polygon is the same walk closed at the end (the closing point is
 * not written — it is the first one again, and writing it twice would only invite the two copies
 * to disagree).
 *
 * A label rather than the note's content so the shape rides the attribute payload the way
 * `#geolocation` does: the map draws every shape the moment its children load, with no fetch per
 * shape. The trade is a bounded size — a label is no home for a thousand points, which is why the
 * drawing tools are the deliberate, click-a-vertex kind rather than freehand (and why an imported
 * track keeps its own file-note form; see GpxTrack).
