/**
 * Per-request marker for the Electron `trilium-app://` custom-protocol path.
 *
 * The desktop build runs the full Express stack inside the Electron main
 * process. The renderer makes API calls via the custom protocol (see
 * `apps/desktop/src/protocol.ts`), which dispatches a synthesised
 * request through the same Express app instance as the public HTTP listener.
 *
 * Auth and CSRF middleware historically bypassed on the process-wide
 * `isElectron` flag, which meant any TCP request to the desktop's listener
 * (LAN, DNS-rebound browser, co-resident process) shared the bypass.
 * Instead, the dispatcher tags only its own requests with this marker, and
 * middleware checks the marker — so TCP traffic is treated like any other
 * external request.
 *
 * Symbol-keyed so attacker-supplied JSON / headers cannot collide.
