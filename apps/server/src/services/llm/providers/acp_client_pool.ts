/**
 * Keeps one ACP agent subprocess per provider alive across chat turns.
 *
 * Starting an agent and opening a session is expensive: a cold Copilot turn
 * pays ~785 ms to spawn and run `initialize` plus ~2.4 s for the first
 * `session/new`, and Antigravity's server takes ~15 s to start on Windows. None
 * of that is model latency, and all of it repeats on every message when the
 * client is disposed at the end of each turn.
 *
 * ACP is built for sharing: one connection hosts many sessions, each addressed
 * by `sessionId`. So the pool hands every turn the same client, routes each
 * `session/update` and permission request to the turn that owns its session,
 * and reaps the subprocess after {@link IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS} without a turn. A
 * client that dies on its own evicts itself, so the next turn starts a new one.
