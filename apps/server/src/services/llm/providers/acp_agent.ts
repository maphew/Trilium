/**
 * Shared base for the providers that drive a subscription agent over the Agent
 * Client Protocol (ACP) — GitHub Copilot (`copilot --acp`), Google Antigravity
 * (`agy_acp_server`) and OpenAI Codex (through `codex-acp`). The agent runs as a
 * subprocess or in a worker thread, owns the account's authentication, runs its
 * own agentic loop and keeps conversation history in host-side sessions. So
 * every ACP provider:
 *   - implements `chatChunks()` (chunk-native streaming) instead of `chat()`,
 *   - keeps its agent process running between turns (see acp_client_pool.ts),
 *   - maps chat notes to ACP sessions and sends only the newest user message
 *     when the transcript still matches, prompting the session directly while
 *     its process runs and through `session/load` after that, and falls back to
 *     seeding a fresh session from the transcript when it diverged or was lost,
 *   - exposes note tools by pointing the agent at a private loopback MCP
 *     endpoint (see acp_mcp_endpoint.ts), and answers the ACP permission
 *     callback fail-closed.
 *
 * A subclass supplies how to launch its CLI, its model catalog and its
 * permission policy; the protocol handling lives here.
