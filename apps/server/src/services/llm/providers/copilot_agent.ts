/**
 * Copilot Agent provider — drives the GitHub Copilot CLI in ACP mode
 * (`copilot --acp`, the Agent Client Protocol) as a subprocess. This lets
 * users with a GitHub Copilot subscription (Pro/Pro+/Business/Enterprise) use
 * the in-app chat without an API key: authentication is owned entirely by the
 * CLI (`copilot login`, or credentials shared with any other Copilot editor
 * integration on the machine), and usage is billed to the subscription.
 *
 * Bring-your-own-binary: nothing is bundled — the provider spawns the user's
 * own installed `copilot` CLI (see copilot_binary.ts). The protocol handling is
 * shared with the other ACP providers (see acp_agent.ts); Copilot's built-in
 * file/shell tools are denied on its command line and again in the permission
 * callback.

 *     can never run even if a future CLI build changed the permission-prompt
 *     defaults. The agent's only capability surface is Trilium's note tools.
 *   - `--no-custom-instructions` keeps any AGENTS.md/copilot-instructions.md in
